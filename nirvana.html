						<p>&emsp;&emsp;<strong>Ustad Chhote Rahimat Khan</strong> was born on 4th July 1959 into a musically rich family of renowned sitarists. Belonging to the seventh generation of musicians, his unique heritage has assisted in creating an exceptional performer. He took to the sitar at the age of ten and was trained rigorously by his gifted father, the <strong>late Prof. Abdul Karim Khan</strong>, who in turn had been tutored by his father, the <strong>late Sitar Ratna Rahimat Khan.</strong> These two guiding stars of Rahimat's youth, were instrumental in deeply immersing him in the style and values of the <em>'Beenkar'</em> Bande Ali Khan Gharana of sitar playing.</p>
						<p>&emsp;&emsp; His early years saw him emerging as a promising acolyte of his gharana, when, at the age of 15, he won accolades from a gathering of connoisseurs and music lovers. At 19, he was felicitated at the hands of<em> Late Padmabhushan Dr. Gangubai Hangal</em> for his success in the National Level music competition of All India Radio (A.I.R), Delhi. He is recognised all over India as an approved A graded artist of the A.I.R.</p>
						<p><strong>Raushni Khan</strong> and <strong>Mansoor Khan</strong> are young budding talents who has excelled in their respective fields largely making a true inspiration to the nation.</p>
